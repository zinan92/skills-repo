# MVU Execution — Minimum Viable Unit Protocol

The atomic unit of reliable software delivery. One unit in, verified deliverable out.

**Core principle:** Every MVU exits with tests passing and review approved, or it doesn't exit at all.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO MVU MARKED COMPLETE WITHOUT:
  1. Tests passing (fresh run, not "should pass")
  2. Review approved (not self-review alone)
  3. Max 2 roundtrips before escalation (no infinite loops)
```

## What Is an MVU

An MVU is the smallest unit of work that produces an independently verifiable deliverable.

| Property | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Size | 100-300 lines changed (if larger, decompose further) |
| Scope | Single responsibility — one thing done well |
| Testability | Can be independently tested (has clear inputs/outputs) |
| Contract | Has explicit spec: what it should do, what "done" means |
| Completion | 1-2 roundtrips to finish (if not, unit is too big) |

**If a task doesn't fit these criteria, it's not an MVU — decompose it first.**

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    rankdir=TB;
    "Have a task to execute?" [shape=diamond];
    "Task ≤ 300 lines?" [shape=diamond];
    "Has clear spec + success criteria?" [shape=diamond];
    "Use MVU Execution" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ccffcc"];
    "Decompose first (meta-framework Triage)" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ffcccc"];
    "Define spec first (clarify-intention)" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ffcccc"];
    "No task" [shape=box];

    "Have a task to execute?" -> "Task ≤ 300 lines?" [label="yes"];
    "Have a task to execute?" -> "No task" [label="no"];
    "Task ≤ 300 lines?" -> "Has clear spec + success criteria?" [label="yes"];
    "Task ≤ 300 lines?" -> "Decompose first (meta-framework Triage)" [label="no"];
    "Has clear spec + success criteria?" -> "Use MVU Execution" [label="yes"];
    "Has clear spec + success criteria?" -> "Define spec first (clarify-intention)" [label="no"];
}
```

**Standalone (Light task from Triage):** Entire task = 1 MVU. Use this skill directly.
**Within subagent-driven-development:** Each task in the plan is an MVU. This skill governs the per-task execution loop.

## The Protocol

```dot
digraph mvu_protocol {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];

    subgraph cluster_round1 {
        label="Round 1: Develop";
        style=filled; fillcolor="#e8f5e9";
        dev1 [label="Developer (Claude Code #1)\n—\n1. Read task spec\n2. Write tests first\n3. Write code\n4. Run tests\n5. Self-review\n6. Commit"];
    }

    subgraph cluster_round2 {
        label="Round 2: Review";
        style=filled; fillcolor="#e3f2fd";
        rev1 [label="Reviewer (Claude Code #2)\n—\n1. Read spec + code independently\n2. Verify spec compliance\n3. Check code quality\n4. Check edge cases\n5. Produce review comments"];
    }

    subgraph cluster_round3 {
        label="Round 3: Respond";
        style=filled; fillcolor="#e8f5e9";
        dev2 [label="Developer responds to review\n—\nAgree → fix\nDisagree → explain why\nRun tests again"];
    }

    tests_pass1 [label="Tests pass +\nReviewer approves?" shape=diamond];
    done [label="✅ MVU Complete" shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ccffcc"];

    subgraph cluster_escalation {
        label="Escalation: Codex CLI";
        style=filled; fillcolor="#fff3e0";
        codex [label="Codex CLI\n—\nReceives: spec + code + review +\nfailed tests + full context\n—\nDirectly modifies code"];
    }

    tests_pass2 [label="Tests pass?" shape=diamond];
    human [label="🚨 Human Escalation\n—\nUnit is stuck.\nHuman decides:\nfix / redesign / abandon" shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ffcccc"];

    roundtrip_count [label="Roundtrip count ≤ 2?" shape=diamond];

    dev1 -> rev1;
    rev1 -> dev2;
    dev2 -> tests_pass1;
    tests_pass1 -> done [label="yes"];
    tests_pass1 -> roundtrip_count [label="no"];
    roundtrip_count -> rev1 [label="yes — another round"];
    roundtrip_count -> codex [label="no — escalate"];
    codex -> tests_pass2;
    tests_pass2 -> done [label="yes"];
    tests_pass2 -> human [label="no"];
}
```

### Step-by-step

**Step 1 — Dispatch Developer** (use `./developer-prompt.md`)
- Developer gets: full task spec, context, working directory
- Developer MUST: write tests first, implement, run tests, self-review, commit
- Developer CAN: ask questions before starting (answer them before proceeding)

**Step 2 — Dispatch Reviewer** (use `./reviewer-prompt.md`)
- Reviewer gets: task spec, developer's report, access to code
- Reviewer MUST: read actual code (not trust developer's report), verify spec compliance AND code quality in one pass
- Reviewer produces: approved / issues list with file:line references

**Step 3 — Developer responds to review**
- If review approved → MVU Complete ✅
- If issues found → Developer fixes, runs tests, reports back
- Developer CAN disagree with review feedback (with technical reasoning)

**Step 4 — Count roundtrips**
- Roundtrip = one develop → review → fix cycle
- If roundtrip ≤ 2 → send back to Reviewer for re-review
- If roundtrip > 2 → escalate to Codex CLI

**Step 5 — Codex CLI Escalation** (use `./escalation-prompt.md`)
- Codex receives: spec + all code + review history + failed test output
- Codex directly modifies code to resolve issues
- Run tests after Codex changes

**Step 6 — Human Escalation**
- If Codex CLI doesn't resolve → human decides: fix manually, redesign the unit, or abandon
- This should be rare. If it happens frequently, the units are too complex — decompose further.

## Reliability Guarantee

| Stage | Cumulative Reliability |
|-------|----------------------|
| Developer self-test | ~90% |
| + Reviewer catch | 1-(1-0.9)² = ~99% |
| + Codex CLI fallback | ~99.9% |
| + Human escalation | ~100% |

**The goal: every MVU deliverable is something you can rely on 100%.**

## Prompt Templates

- `./developer-prompt.md` — Dispatch developer subagent
- `./reviewer-prompt.md` — Dispatch reviewer subagent (combined spec + quality)
- `./escalation-prompt.md` — Dispatch Codex CLI for stuck units

## Red Flags — STOP

- Marking MVU complete without fresh test run
- Skipping review ("it's only 50 lines")
- Developer and reviewer are the same agent instance (must be separate)
- Roundtrip count > 2 without escalating
- Escalating to Codex without providing full context (spec + code + review + tests)
- Unit > 300 lines (decompose first, don't stretch)
- No spec / success criteria defined (define first, don't wing it)
- Accepting "close enough" on spec compliance
- Infinite review loops (that's what the 2-roundtrip cap prevents)

**ALL of these mean: STOP and fix the process, not the code.**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "It's trivial, skip review" | Trivial bugs still ship. Review anyway. |
| "Tests pass so review is redundant" | Tests verify behavior, review verifies design. Both needed. |
| "Just one more roundtrip" | Cap is 2. Escalate. Fresh eyes solve what loops can't. |
| "Codex is overkill for this" | If 2 rounds didn't fix it, your approach has a blind spot. Escalate. |
| "The unit is 400 lines but it's cohesive" | Split it. Cohesion is not an excuse for oversizing. |
| "I'll review my own code" | Self-review is Step 1. External review is Step 2. Both required. |

## Integration

**This skill is the atomic building block. Other skills compose it:**

- **superpowers:subagent-driven-development** — uses MVU Execution for each task in a plan
- **superpowers:executing-plans** — uses MVU Execution for each batch item
- **Standalone** — for Light tasks from meta-framework Triage (entire task = 1 MVU)

**This skill requires:**

- **superpowers:test-driven-development** — Developer must follow TDD within the MVU
- **superpowers:verification-before-completion** — evidence before any completion claim
- **superpowers:requesting-code-review** — review template for Reviewer dispatch

**Escalation requires:**

- Codex CLI installed and accessible (`codex` command available)
- If Codex not available, Human Escalation is the fallback for roundtrip > 2
